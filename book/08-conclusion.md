# Conclusion

Over the course of this book, we've learned the skills needed to grow and
maintain an open source project: how to encourage the collaboration styles we
prefer, how to communicate effectively with the team and contributors, how to
improve productivity leveraging Git and GitHub, how to consistently keep good
quality, what version numbers mean, how to build and publish releases, how to
write useful documentation, the different ways of making our work freely
available through the use of copyright laws, and how to prioritize all these
tasks.

These topics describe how open source teams work, but are equally useful for
organizations building products that, while not meant to be freely available,
are developed in collaboration with many people. Following open source practices
is a reliable way of incorporating the benefits of modern development practices
into internal workflows, making our organizations more efficient.

You now have the tools to develop and lead better projects following open source
practices. Keep on collaborating!
