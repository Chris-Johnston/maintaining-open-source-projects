# Maintaining Open Source Projects


### Pitch

There are many aspects to fostering an open source project: building community,
promoting the library, maintaining good communication, among other factors. This
book is our take on how to create, grow and maintain a successful open source
project.


### Thesis

A successful open source project is not only one that is original, solves a
particular problem well, or has pristine code quality. Those are but the tip of
the iceberg, which we'll thoroughly dissect with this book.


### Who is the target audience of this book?

Any person or company who finds themselves as maintainers (could be by chance!)
of an open source project.

If have any public repositories in GitHub, and someone you don't know is using
your projects, this book is useful for you.

You may also find it interesting as a manager or company owner, as many
companies successfully apply open source practices in their day-to-day work.

### Why do they want to buy and read it?

Your project may have a following and you don't know how to communicate with it,
how to prioritize their requests, how to answer questions.

You want to learn the communication patterns that make it possible for a large
and popular Open Source projects to move forward, while your 5-people team can't
come to agreement on things like how to name a variable.

You want to make sure your bar is high enough for providing a reliable project
for your following.

You want to follow best practices but can't know them all. When to release new
versions, how to decide version numbers, when to open source, when to add
contributors, what to automate.

You want to get your project more attention and grow its user base.


# Keep always in mind

* Other languages and communities than what we are used to
* Think if ideas make sense both for small and huge communities and projects
