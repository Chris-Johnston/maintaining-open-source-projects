# Bazaar vs Cathedral

http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=884726

I run a 12+ person development team working on mission critical R&D tools at a
major aerospace company. Having a larger development community is not necessary
an advantage. Often when teams get too large they start to have all kinds of
problems that hinder successful development.

You can argue all day that code open to analysis is better/safer, but it means
nothing if it isn’t independent analysis. So what if the Keepass community can
analyze its own code. They will be naturally biased and will make assumptions
that an independent reviewer won’t. That would be like me claiming my code
doesn’t need Q&A because I already did that myself. It just doesn’t work that
way.
