# Cover

For now it will be the color/title thing. You can ask for help in design or take
a whack at it yourself - the cover .ai is in dropbox somewhere.


# Marketing copy

See each link in http://thoughtbot.com/books for examples.
As long as you don’t publish it, you’re welcome to work directly in Gumroad,
just make a new product.


# Blog post announcing the book
