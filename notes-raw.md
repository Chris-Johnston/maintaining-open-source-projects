It’s better to contribute upstream than to fork:

Vim creator on NeoVim fork:

I do hope that the nice things that NeoVim comes up with can be added back to
Vim. I mean, who doesn’t want better plugin support, a better GUI and embedding?
The big question is how to do that, and who is going to implement it properly.

Bazaar vs Cathedral
http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=884726

I run a 12+ person development team working on mission critical R&D tools at a
major aerospace company. Having a larger development community is not necessary
an advantage. Often when teams get too large they start to have all kinds of
problems that hinder successful development.

You can argue all day that code open to analysis is better/safer, but it means
nothing if it isn’t independent analysis. So what if the Keepass community can
analyze its own code. They will be naturally biased and will make assumptions
that an independent reviewer won’t. That would be like me claiming my code
doesn’t need Q&A because I already did that myself. It just doesn’t work that
way.

“Thanks - I agree, that would be a good addition to the docs. It would be really
helpful if you could add that and submit a pull request. Thanks!” en lugar de lo
que escribí yo, que estuvo mal.
